            <p>If any chance you don't know what forum website is. It is 'An online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.They differ from chat rooms in that messages are often longer than one line of text, and are at least temporarily archived.'</p>

            <h1><b>Why this website?</b></h1>
            <p>Since beginning of my journey in Bachelor in Computer Application (BCA), I always feel like there is lack of mentor. Solution of errors, bugs and other problems in my code is hard to slove. So I always feel like there should be website where I can communicate with my college teachers, seniors, friends and juniors. And as introduces of our first project in fourth semester, at first I have no idea of what project should be then I decide why shouldn`t I create a website where I can discuss about it. So I create a website name ùïÆ-sOLUTION where `ùïÆ‚Äô means Code and `sOLUTION‚Äô means it‚Äôs remedy. This website act like a mentor to upcoming IT students of our college. They will be guide by experiences one on their code. If you have any problems in your code be feel to post it, there will be immeditate response with understandable solution. </p>
